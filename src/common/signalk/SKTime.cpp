  1.0  6  Jan 2010 - initial release
  1.1  12 Feb 2010 - fixed leap year calculation error
  1.2  1  Nov 2010 - fixed setTime bug (thanks to Korman for this)
  1.3  24 Mar 2012 - many edits by Paul Stoffregen: fixed timeStatus() to update
                     status, updated examples for Arduino 1.0, fixed ARM
                     compatibility issues, added TimeArduinoDue and TimeTeensy3
                     examples, add error checking and messages to RTC examples,
                     add examples to DS1307RTC library.
  1.4  5  Sep 2014 - compatibility with Arduino 1.5.7
